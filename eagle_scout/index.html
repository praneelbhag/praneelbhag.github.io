            <h1>Eagle Scout</h1>
            <h3>Scouting Journey</h3>
            <p>My Boy Scouts journey began in 9th grade, where I steadily advanced through various leadership roles, culminating in my election as Senior Patrol Leader (SPL), the highest youth leadership position in the troop. I oversaw activities for over 40 scouts, coordinated meetings, camping trips, and service projects. Scouting helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and communication skills, and provided invaluable outdoor experiences that shaped my character and commitment to service.</p>
            <h3>Eagle Scout Project</h3>
            <p>For my Eagle Scout project, I organized a community initiative to provide meals for children from economically challenged families. With a team of 40 volunteers, we assembled and decorated over 225 lunch bags, exceeding our goal by 80%. Each bag was filled with nutritious meals and personalized with thoughtful drawings by volunteers to bring joy to the children. The project received strong community support and was a rewarding experience in leadership and project management.</p>
