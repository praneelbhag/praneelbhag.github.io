            <h3>1. 3D-Printed Face Masks (2020-2022)</h3>
            <p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Three Mask-eteers focused on designing and 3D-printing protective face masks for those in need. We donated over 400 masks, each equipped with spare filters, to teachers, first responders, local politicians, and immunocompromised community members.</p>
            <h3>2. 3D-Printed Face Shields for Rural Hospitals in India (2021)</h3>
            <p>As the COVID-19 Delta variant surged, we shifted our focus to supporting healthcare workers in rural India by donating 480 3D-printed face shields.</p>
            <h3>3. RPM Boards for Nonverbal Autistic Children (2022-2023)</h3>
            <p>We designed and 3D-printed RPM boards, allowing nonverbal autistic children to communicate by pointing to letters to form words and sentences.</p>
            <h3>4. 3D-Printed Prosthetic Hand for a Venezuelan Refugee (2024)</h3>
            <p>We created a custom 3D-printed prosthetic hand for a 7-year-old Venezuelan refugee who lost his hand, helping him regain the ability to perform daily tasks.</p>
