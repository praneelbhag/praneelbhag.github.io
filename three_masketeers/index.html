            <!-- Emphasizing the 3D-Printed Prosthetic Hand -->
            <h2>1. 3D-Printed Prosthetic Hand for a Venezuelan Refugee (2024)</h2>
            <p>As part of our efforts to make a tangible difference in peopleâ€™s lives, The Three Mask-eteers designed and 3D-printed a custom prosthetic hand for a 7-year-old Venezuelan refugee who lost his hand in a car accident. By using 3D scans of his arm, we ensured the prosthetic was specially fitted, enabling the child to regain the ability to perform everyday tasks and improve his quality of life.</p>

            <!-- Additional Projects in the order of importance -->
            <h3>2. 3D-Printed Face Masks (2020-2022)</h3>
            <p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Three Mask-eteers focused on designing and 3D-printing protective face masks for those in need. We donated over 400 masks, each equipped with spare filters, to teachers, first responders, local politicians, and immunocompromised community members. These efforts ensured that essential workers and vulnerable individuals had access to reliable protection.</p>

            <h3>3. 3D-Printed Face Shields for Rural Hospitals in India (2021)</h3>
            <p>As the COVID-19 Delta variant surged, we shifted our focus to supporting under-resourced healthcare workers in rural India. The Three Mask-eteers 3D-printed and assembled 480 face shields, which were donated to rural hospitals. These face shields provided critical protection to frontline healthcare workers, helping to safeguard them during the pandemic.</p>

            <h3>4. RPM Boards for Nonverbal Autistic Children (2022-2023)</h3>
            <p>In addition to pandemic-related efforts, The Three Mask-eteers expanded its mission to support special needs communities. We designed and 3D-printed specialized RPM (Rapid Prompting Method) boards for nonverbal autistic children. These boards allowed the children to communicate by pointing to letters to form words and sentences, empowering them to better express their thoughts to their caretakers.</p>
