            <h3>1. Founding the SeaPerch and Robotics Club</h3>
            <p>Driven by a passion for robotics and engineering, I founded the SeaPerch and Robotics Club at my high school to give students hands-on experience in underwater robotics. Starting from scratch, I recruited over 20 members and formed 4 competitive teams. I organized regular meetings, workshops, and hands-on projects where students developed technical skills in engineering, coding, and robotics.</p>

            <p>In addition to building a strong team, I focused on outreach by conducting volunteer workshops at local elementary and middle schools, inspiring younger students to explore STEM through fun, hands-on activities. This not only prepared them for future competitions but also fostered a passion for science and technology within our community.</p>

            <h3>2. International SeaPerch Competition Success</h3>
            <p>As team captain, I led our schoolâ€™s SeaPerch team to the 2024 SeaPerch International Competition, where we placed 4th overall. We achieved 2nd place in both the engineering notebook and obstacle course categories, showcasing our technical expertise and teamwork. Competing at the international level was a rewarding challenge, and our strong collaboration and dedication resulted in impressive achievements on a global stage.</p>

            <p>Through SeaPerch, I learned how to work under pressure, lead a team, and solve complex engineering problems. The experience solidified my passion for robotics and engineering, and I look forward to continuing this work in the future.</p>
