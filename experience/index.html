            <h1>Experience</h1>

            <h3>Texas Southern University RISE Summer Research — Machine Learning with Python (10th-11th grade)</h3>
            <p>Developed a Python-based machine learning model to predict glaucoma and macular degeneration by analyzing OCT retinal scans. This experience strengthened my coding expertise and demonstrated Python's impact on medical diagnostics.</p>

            <h3>Science and Engineering Fair of Houston — Biomedical Engineering with Python (9th-11th grade)</h3>
            <p>Achieved 1st place at SEFH, advancing to state with a Python-based machine learning model to detect cancerous moles. I also developed a smartphone attachment for clearer imaging. Python played a pivotal role in building this complex, impactful solution.</p>

            <!-- Split the Teaching Section into Two -->
            <h3>Teaching Special Needs Students — Volunteer Programs (9th–12th grade)</h3>
            <p>Developed a curriculum and hosted classes to teach special needs students Scratch programming and 3D design. This initiative empowered students to learn coding and 3D modeling skills in an engaging and accessible way.</p>

            <h3>Teaching Python — Volunteer Programs (12th grade)</h3>
            <p>Hosted virtual Python classes, teaching students the fundamentals of coding and helping them develop projects using Python. This experience improved my leadership and communication skills as I tailored lessons to fit students' varying skill levels.</p>
