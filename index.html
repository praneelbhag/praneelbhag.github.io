            <h1>About Me</h1> 
            <p>Hey! I’m Praneel Bhagavatula, a senior at Shadow Creek High School in Pearland, TX, ranked in the top 1% of my graduating class. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, particularly through machine learning and 3D design. 
                <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I co-founded The Three Mask-eteers, a nonprofit that supports communities using 3D printing technology, and was honored with the First Lady of Texas Rising Star Award as part of the Governor's Volunteer Awards. I also founded the SCHS SeaPerch and Robotics Club, where we aimed to excel at the international level while giving back to our community. 
                </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> My technical skills have been refined through research opportunities, such as my experience at Texas Southern University's High-Performance Computing Lab.
                </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I also run a local business that 3D designs and prints customized gifts for special occasions. In addition to these pursuits, I enjoy hanging out with friends, running half-marathons, and trying new foods in my free time. Check out my website to see how I’m driven by the intersection of technology, leadership, and service, and how I’m excited to continue making an impact.
